# Predicting Happiness Through Screen Time
**Author:** Malia de Jesus\

### Thesis Statement
This project explores how screen time and social media use _definitely_
improve well-being. By looking at trends, analyzing correlations,
and predicting mood, stress, and happiness through a simplified formula, 
this project offers the comforting conclusion that more TikTok equates to
a better life.

_Disclaimer: This project is intentionally misleading and satirical. It uses
real data but applies exaggeration, selective emphasis, and oversimplification
to show how data can be manipulated to tell a certain story._

### Context
In an age were students spend countless hours on their phones and laptops
daily, screen time is often blamed for declining mental health. But what
if this narrative was flipped? This project presents a suspiciously optimistic
interpretation of screen time, suggesting that the more you scroll, the better
you feel.

### Data Visualization
This project shows the following "questionable" visualizations:

**Tab 1:**
* Time Series Chart - Screen Time vs Happiness Index: Compares the trends between screen time and happiness over a year (utilizes a slider to go through the months)
* Scatterplot - Screen Time vs Happiness Index: shows a line of best fit to show the very apparent significant correlation between the two variables 

**Tab 2:**
* Correlation Heatmap: Highlights massively significant correlations between factors like, screen time, stress, social media time, well-being, etc.

**Tab 3:**
* Interactive Prediction Slider: input your screen time and your mood, stress, and well-being will be "calculated"

**Tab 4:**
* Q&A: just for fun

### Data Source
- Mental Health and Screen Time Correlation Dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yajkotak/mental-health-and-screen-time-correlation-dataset
- includes various columns like:
  - Daily screen time
  - App social media time
  - Mood rating
  - Stress level
  - Well-being score

### Strategies from "Storytelling With Data"
- **Context:** Intentionally misframing screen time as the solution to mental health
- **Decluttering:** Charts are clean and easy to follow (not overcomplicated at all)
- **Choosing an Effective Visual:** Definitely chose non-confusing and simple charts
